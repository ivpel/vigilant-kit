# Vigilant Kit
Vigilant is a set of tools designed to help write and run robust functional tests using Selenium WebDriver. It provides
methods for interacting with the WebBrowser, assertions, and waiting. With Vigilant, you can start writing complex test
cases in a minute.

## Why Vigilant?
- **Easy to start & Fast To Write**: Easy configuration process, straightforward way to writing your tests.
Vigilant provides you with methods that help you write functional tests quickly without spending time on writing 
boilerplate code every time you start a new project. 
- **Flexible Framework Usage**: Usage is not limited to a single testing framework; you can use Vigilant with unittest,
  pytest, or anything else.

## What it includes?
Methods for **interacting** with WebBrowser (`click`, `scroll_to`,  etc.), **assertions** (`see`, `dont_see`, `see_text`
, etc.) **waiters** (`wait_for_element_to_be_visible`, `wait_for_element_to_be_clickable`, etc.)
It is already there, ready to use.

Also, a bunch of CLI scripts, to make your life easier!

Use `vgl --help` to see all available commands.

## Extending Functionality
If you need something that is not covered in this library, you still have access to all native `Selenium WebDriver` 
methods. You can create your own methods or use native `WebDriver` methods and share them on one browser session.

## Install
```shell
pip install vigilant-kit
```
