# Vigilant Kit

Vigilant is a set of tools made to simplify writing and running robust functional tests using Selenium WebDriver. 



## Why Vigilant?
 - It allows you to start writing complex test cases in a minute.
 - Simple configuration process (just one `.vigilant.env` file to start)
 - Usage is not limited to a single testing framework, it can be used with `unittest`, `pytest` or anything else.
It is up to you.

## Flexibility 
**Vigilant** provide you with methods that help write functional tests fast, without spending your time on writing smart
waiters, finders and assertions. Methods for interacting with WebBrowser (`click`, `scroll_to`, etc.), assertions 
(`see`, `dont_see`, `see_text`, etc.) It is already there, ready to use.

What if you need something that is not covered in this library?

You still have access to all `WebDriver` methods. Despite all functional that library provide - you can create your own 
methods or use native `WebDriver` methods.
