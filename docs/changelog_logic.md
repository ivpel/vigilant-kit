# CHANGELOG Logic

Our project adheres to a structured versioning system to keep our users informed about updates and changes in a clear and consistent manner. Each release version is denoted by three numbers, formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`), where each part of the version number has a specific meaning regarding the nature of the changes it includes. Hereâ€™s what each part represents:

## MAJOR Version Updates (`1.x.x`)

A change in the MAJOR version number indicates significant architectural changes to the project. These updates are substantial, potentially affecting the project's structure, dependencies, or compatibility with previous versions. MAJOR updates are implemented when there are changes that:

- Alter the project's architecture or core functionality in a way that might require user intervention to adapt or migrate existing setups.
- Introduce backward-incompatible changes that are necessary for the project's long-term viability and improvement.

When the MAJOR version number increments (e.g., from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x`), users can expect fundamental changes that enhance the project's capabilities or address crucial architectural evolutions.

## MINOR Version Updates (`x.2.x`)

A change in the MINOR version number signifies the addition of new, significant functionality that was not present in previous versions. These updates expand the project's capabilities without disrupting its overall architecture. MINOR updates include:

- Introduction of new features or modules that offer significant new capabilities or improvements.
- Enhancements that add value to existing features, providing users with more flexibility, efficiency, or ease of use.

MINOR version changes (e.g., `1.2.x` to `1.3.x`) introduce new functionalities that enrich the project without necessitating major adaptations from the users.

## PATCH Version Updates (`x.x.3`)

A change in the PATCH version number reflects improvements and refinements to the project that might include new methods, refactoring of existing code, documentation updates, or other minor enhancements. PATCH updates are focused on:

- Refining and optimizing the project's functionality, making it more reliable, efficient, or user-friendly.
- Adding new methods or minor features that complement existing functionalities without significantly altering the user experience.
- Updating documentation to improve clarity, completeness, or accuracy, helping users to better understand and utilize the project.

Incrementing the PATCH number (e.g., `1.2.3` to `1.2.4`) assures users of improvements and refinements that enhance the project's quality and usability without introducing drastic changes.

This logic ensures that version numbers convey meaningful information about the nature and impact of changes, allowing users to make informed decisions about when and how to update the project in their environment.
